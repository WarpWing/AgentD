The program is designed to give students a strong academic foundation and a set of practical skills that are applicable to many different fields. The curriculum is built around enduring principles, foundational theories, and modern practices. Students in the program design and build software in multiple programming languages, work collaboratively in teams, and engage with real-world projects on local, regional, national, and global scales. \n\nThe Computer Science major at Dickinson has a suggested curricular flow through the major, organized into four main areas: Programming & the Scientific Core; Electives; Abstraction & Systems; and Tools & Practices. Early courses introduce basic tools and techniques for software development, and provide general, concrete programming skills. Intermediate-level courses explore how complex computing systems are organized and function, and expand practical skills through participation in real-world projects. Later courses investigate in-depth topics, including operating systems, computer networks, artificial intelligence, database systems, programming languages, and the theoretical limits of what computers can and cannot do. \n\nStudents can also take advantage of study abroad opportunities, with strong computer science programs at The University of East Anglia in Norwich, England; The University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand; and the Danish Institute for Study Abroad in Copenhagen, Denmark. Students with strong foreign language skills have also studied computer science in Germany, Russia, Italy, and Japan. \n\nRecent graduates have begun careers with large technology companies, small consulting firms, startups, non-profits, and more. Others have pursued graduate studies in areas including computer science, software engineering, robotics, law, and medicine."}, {"role": "User", "message": "Can you tell me about the Department Head at Dickinson College?"}, {"role": "Chatbot", "message": "The Department Head for the Computer Science Department at Dickinson College is Professor Jennifer Schaefer.

The CSE offers over 100 sustainability-related courses each academic year, and supports dozens of co-curricular groups and research projects. The CSE also runs the Valley & Ridge faculty-development workshop, which helps faculty members from Dickinson and other colleges and universities think through social, economic, and environmental sustainability issues, and incorporate them into their courses. \n\nDickinson\'s commitment to sustainability is also reflected in its student initiatives and campus infrastructure. Students can live and work together to promote sustainability efforts at the Treehouse, also known as the Center for Sustainable Living, a special-interest house on campus.

Mellon Foundation and matching contributions from the college. The CSE was founded alongside the launch of Dickinson\'s comprehensive, institution-wide sustainability initiative, with the intent that the center would lead and enable the development of sustainability as a defining characteristic of a Dickinson education. \n\nThe CSE has played a pivotal role in leading the student learning dimensions of the initiative and supporting college-wide sustainability goals that extend beyond the student learning experience. The CSE has pursued and achieved goals set in the 2010 report \"Charting the Path for a Sustainable Dickinson\" and the 2021 CSE Strategic Plan, making sustainability a pillar of a Dickinson education. \n\nThe CSE creates, enhances, and connects opportunities for learning about sustainability through the curriculum, research, co-curricular activities, and civic engagement. The CSE offers over 100 sustainability-related courses each academic year and supports dozens of co-curricular groups and research projects. \n\nThe CSE Steering Committee advises the Center and acts as a liaison between the Center and the faculty, administration, staff, and students. The 2023-24 members include:\n- Michael Beevers, Associate Professor, Environmental Studies\n- Erin Crawley-Woods, Assistant Professor, Theatre and Dance\n- Phoebe Galione, Outreach Manager, Alliance for Aquatic Resource Monitoring\n- Juliana Gianni, Student, \'24\n- Jenn Halpin, Manager, Dickinson College Farm\n- Neil Leary, Director, Center for Sustainability Education\n- Lindsey Lyons, Assistant Director, Center for Sustainability Education\n- Laura Megivern, Director, Center for Civic Learning & Action\n- Marissa Mitchell, Associate Director Education Abroad, Center for Global Study & Engagement\n- Aidan Ray, Student, \'25\n- Ming Robinson, Student, \'25\n- Katie Schweighofer, Director, Women\'s and Gender Resource Center\n- Ken Shultes, Associate Vice President, Sustainability and Facilities Planning\n- Sarah St. Angelo, Associate Professor, Chemistry\n- Ed Webb, Associate Professor, Political Science & International Studies\n\nThe CSE also produces a Sustainability E-Newsletter, which is student-produced, released bi-weekly, and covers all of Dickinson\'s current sustainability news, events, jobs, and opportunities. \n\nThe Director of the CSE is Neil Leary, who came to Dickinson in 2008 as the founding director. He has researched climate change vulnerability, adaptation, and mitigation for 20 years and led international climate change projects in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. He is a member of the editorial board of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and has participated in the scientific assessments of the IPCC since the 1990s. \n\nThe Assistant Director of the CSE is Lindsey Lyons, who has received national attention for her leadership in working to embed sustainability across the curriculum. She enjoys working at the intersection of sustainability with education abroad, equity & inclusion, and civic engagement. She has overseen many initiatives that have helped Dickinson secure recognition for its sustainability efforts, including being named a #1 Sierra Magazine Cool School and a Princeton Review Green Honor Roll institution."}],
